Happy Hacking!
You can focus on the easy challenges to start with. Those marked 1 star or 2 stars are a good place to start. Look at the following instructions to discover the challenges.

The first thing you want to do is to find the scoreboard. This will show you want challenges are available and allow you and your team to keep track of your score. 

The documentation has some useful pointers to help you with the challenges. Here are some useful starting points:
